## AI Snake

This repository now includes `snake_ai.py`, a simple snake game driven by an AI.
The AI follows a precomputed Hamiltonian cycle so it never collides with itself
or the walls, effectively preventing game over.

### Requirements
- Python 3.12
- `pygame` (install with `pip install pygame`)

### Running
Execute the script with:

```bash
python3 snake_ai.py
```

A window will open showing the snake automatically collecting food forever.
